## Advanced Features 

### 1. Petrol Consumption according to Size of Truck

Trucks are rated according to size as follows:
- S - 1
- M - 2
- L - 3
- XL - 4
Where 1, 2, 3 and 4 represent the petrol consumption of the vehicle according to size.

These sizes are specified in the input directly after the driver's home node number. 
For example, the line:
0 3 4 2 6 3
Specifies drivers at nodes 0, 4 and 6 with a petrol consumption factor of 3, 2 and 3 respectively. 

The petrol factor is then used to determine the best driver as the total cost of the route is multiplied by the petrol factor, and then the driver with the minimum overall cost is chosen. The petrol factor is also used when finding the best route for each leg of the journey in order that the correct overall cost may be determined. 

An example of this feature works as follows:
The input 
8
0 1 2 2 5 
1 0 3 3 4
2 5 9 6 4 7 17 
3 1 7 4 5
4 2 11
5 3 9
6 5 5
7
3
0 3 4 2 6 3

2 5 
#

will result in an output of 

client 2 5
truck 4
4 2
pickup 2
multiple solutions cost 18
dropoff 5
5 3 4

It can be seen that truck 4 is chosen as the best driver due to a combination of its proximity and lower petrol factor. Thus if the petrol consumption factors were to be changed, a different result would occur. (This is a variation of the example given in the brief and thus the differences between the original and added petrol feature are evident, as truck 0 is chosen in the original brief.)

It can also be observed that the overall cost of the route has been altered by the petrol factor, as can be seen by the 'multiple solutions cost 18' line which was originally 'multiple solutions cost 9'. Hence the effects of the multiplying factor can be clearly seen.  



### 2. Traffic Updates Causing Changes to Graph Weightings

The second updated feature includes processing traffic reports which are interspersed with client requests.
The program first checks if the next sequence of characters represents a client request or a traffic report and thus the program allows for any number of these consecutively. 

If the next sequence represents a traffic report, it will start with the value -1. 
The next two values then represent the start node and end node defining the edge (or route) whose weight must be updated.
The third value represents the traffic factor that should be added onto the original weight of that edge.
In this way, the original information regarding the weight of that route is maintained, while traffic congestion is taken into account by adding a particular value, which can be updated again later if traffic has lessened.

Traffic congestion is specified as follows:
- Light - 1
- Moderate - 2
- Congested - 3
- Heavy - 4
- Traffic jam - 5

When an update is received, the traffic congestion factor will updated for the specified edge. 
Total weight for each edge is thus a combination of the original weight (representing the route length) 
and the current traffic factor (which can change if updated by a later traffic report).
For example, the line
-1 2 6 2
Indicates that the weight of the edge from vertex 2 to vertex 6 must be increased by two in order to reflect moderate traffic.

A full example of this feature works as follows:
8
0 1 2 2 5 
1 0 3 3 4
2 5 9 6 4 7 17 
3 1 7 4 5
4 2 11
5 3 9
6 5 5
7
3
0 3 4 2 6 3
3
2 5 
-1 2 6 2
2 5
#

Giving an output of:
client 2 5
truck 4
4 2
pickup 2
multiple solutions cost 18
dropoff 5
5 3 4
client 2 5
truck 4
4 2
pickup 2
2 5
dropoff 5
5 3 4

It can be seen that before the traffic update, the weightings were such that there were multiple solutions for the route from 2 to 5. After the traffic update, there is only one route from 2 to 5. This occurred as the edge from 2 to 6 has increased in weight and thus the alternative route not including this edge is cheaper.
